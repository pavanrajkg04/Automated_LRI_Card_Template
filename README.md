# Automated_LRI_Card_Template
This project will create cards for 35 lakh farmers covering 25 lakh hectares, detailing land parcels and integrating DSS results. Each card provides geographic, soil, topography, and climate data, along with crop, nutrient, and water management advice, empowering farmers to optimize land use and boost productivity sustainably.
